# Guess My Number
#
# The computer picks a random number between 1 and 1000
# The player tries to guess it and the computer lets
# the player know if the guess is too high, too low
# or right on the money.

# Example:
#
# Hello! What is your name?
# >>>James
# Well, James, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
# Take a guess.
# >>>50
# Your guess is too high.
# Take a guess.
# >>>20
# Your guess is too low.
# Take a guess.
# >>>42
# Good job, James! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!
